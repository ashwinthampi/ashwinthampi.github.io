        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my Personal Website!</p>
        <p>I am a student at Purdue University majoring in Computer Engineering. Aside from my academic pursuits, I am part of the Japanese Student Association 
            and bilingual in Japanese and I also participate in Purdue University’s Global Engineering Alliance for Research and Education (GEARE) program which 
            focuses to cultivate a future workforce that is competent in technical, professional, and global skills. In addition, I was also a competitive pianist 
            that has won numerous awards and a former assistant coach apprentice for Coerver Colorado. By doing various unique activities and winning numerous awards 
            and earning an official Japanese Government middle school diploma from the Japanese School of Denver, I have developed excellent communication and 
            teamwork skills that are vital in the tech industry. I am also excited about tackling new challenges and meeting new people so for any questions or if 
            you want to chat, please contact me through my emails or my socials!</p>
