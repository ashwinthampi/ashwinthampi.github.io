        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h2>Digital Etch-A-Sketch</h2>
        <p>November 2024</p>
        <p>STM32 Microcontroller, C Programming, Embedded Systems Design (UART, SPI, I2C, RISC-V)</p>
        <p>The Etch-a-Sketch Emulator project involved designing and implementing an interactive drawing system using an STM32 microcontroller and various peripheral devices. 
            Key functionalities and features included:</p> 
        <p>1. Interactive Display: Implemented a TFT LCD display controlled via the SPI protocol to trace lines based on user input from potentiometers.</p> 
        <p>2. Analog-to-Digital Conversion: Utilized the STM32's internal ADC to translate analog voltages from two potentiometers into positional data for drawing.</p> 
        <p>3. Persistent Storage: Integrated an SD card reader using SPI to save and retrieve user drawings, enabling persistent storage of designs across sessions.</p> 
        <p>4. Motion-Based Reset and Navigation: Employed an external I2C accelerometer to detect shake motions for clearing the screen and tilting actions to navigate 
            between saved drawings.</p> 
        <p>5. Peripheral Integration: Configured internal peripherals, including timers for display updates and DMA for efficient ADC data handling.</p>
        <h2>The Lunar Lander</h2>
        <p>November 2023</p>
        <p>SystemVerilog, Field Programmable Gate Arrays</p>
        <p>The Lunar Lander Project involved a sophisticated design and development of a Moon Lander utilizing SystemVerilog and a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). 
            The project's core comprised four integral units:</p>
        <p>1. Memory Unit: A repository for crucial flight data.</p>
        <p>2. Arithmetic Unit: Responsible for critical computational tasks, ensuring accurate adjustments to the lander's trajectory.</p>
        <p>3. Control Unit: This unit was pivotal in determining the lander's status, specifically monitoring for potential crash or land scenarios.</p>
        <p>4. Display Unit: Visually presenting key parameters such as altitude, thrust, velocity, and fuel levels on the FPGA.</p>
        <p>For this project, I used sequential state machines for coherent workflow management and integrating modules corresponding to each unit. Additionally, I included 
            the utilization of SystemVerilog for implementing arithmetic operations, pivotal in the accurate functioning of the Lander and integrating the modules for each unit.</p>
        <h2>Personal Website</h2>
        <p>October 2023 - Present</p>
        <p> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
        <p>Currently in the development of a personal website, employing a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. HTML is used for the text and structure,
            CSS is used for the style of the texts and the formatting, and JavaScript is used for the animations.</p>
        <h2>Optimizing Sensor Placement, Weather Forecast Analysis, and Day Prediction Using NYC Bicycle Traffic Data</h2>
        <p>March 2023 - May 2023</p>
        <p>Python, Data Science</p>
        <p> Optimized sensor placement on bridges for accurate overall traffic estimation with a limited budget and investigated the use of weather forecasts 
            (low/high temperature and precipitation) for predicting high-traffic days by employing a simple linear regression on the dataset.</p>
        <p>Examined the relationship between daily bicycle counts and the prediction of the current day of the week (Monday to Sunday) by utilizing a K-Means 
            Clustering algorithm.</p>
        <h2>Basic Audio Equalizer</h2>
        <p>November 2022 - December 2022</p>
        <p><a href ="Final_Project_Formal_Report.pdf">click here for the project report</a></p>
        <p>Developed an analog audio equalizer using filters, op-amps, and inverted amplifiers to adjust bass, treble, and high frequencies, applying key electrical 
            engineering principles like Ohm's Law.</p>
        <p>Utilized Oscilloscope, Digital Multimeter, Wave Generator, and Power Supply for circuit analysis and value determination, ensuring proper functioning and 
            adherence to specific frequency and RMS Voltage requirements.</p>
        <p>Built and tested various subsystems, including Volume Control and Independent Filters, focusing on generating clean sine waves and maintaining sound 
            quality through rigorous testing and adjustments.</p>
        <p>Demonstrated successful application of theoretical knowledge in a real-world project, overcoming challenges with circuit components and achieving desired 
            audio quality through meticulous data collection and analysis.</p>
        <h2>NaturalCatalyst Enzyme Kinematics Analysis Project: Michaelis Constant Algorithm Development</h2>
        <p>Jan 2022 - May 2022</p>
        <p>MATLAB, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office</p>
        <p>Designed an algorithm using MATLAB that finds the Michaelis Constant using different values.</p>
        <p>Using previous knowledge of data science, developed models that plot the data</p>
