        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h2>The Lunar Lander</h2>
        <p>November 2023</p>
        <p>SystemVerilog, Field Programmable Gate Array</p>
        <p>In the Lunar Lander Project involved a sophisticated design and development of a Moon Lander utilizing SystemVerilog and a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). 
            The project's core comprised four integral units:</p>
        <p>1. Memory Unit: A repository for crucial flight data.</p>
        <p>2. Arithmetic Unit: Responsible for critical computational tasks, ensuring accurate adjustments to the lander's trajectory.</p>
        <p>3. Control Unit: This unit was pivotal in determining the lander's status, specifically monitoring for potential crash or land scenarios.</p>
        <p>4. Display Unit: Visually presenting key parameters such as altitude, thrust, velocity, and fuel levels on the FPGA.</p>
        <p>For this project, I leveraged sequential state machines for coherent workflow management, meticulously integrating modules corresponding to each unit. 
            Additionally, my approach included the strategic utilization of SystemVerilog for implementing essential arithmetic operations, pivotal in the accurate functioning 
            of the Lander and integrating the modules for each unit that completes the Lander.</p>

        <p>October 2023 - Present</p>
        <p> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
        <p>Currently in the development of a personal website, employing a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. HTML is used for the text and structure,
            CSS is used for the style of the texts and the formatting, and JavaScript is used for the animations.</p>
        <h2>Optimizing Sensor Placement, Weather Forecast Analysis, and Day Prediction Using NYC Bicycle Traffic Data</h2>
        <p>March 2023 - May 2023</p>
        <p>Python, Data Science</p>
        <p> Optimized sensor placement on bridges for accurate overall traffic estimation with a limited budget and investigated the use of weather forecasts 
            (low/high temperature and precipitation) for predicting high-traffic days by employing a simple linear regression on the dataset.</p>
        <p>Examined the relationship between daily bicycle counts and the prediction of the current day of the week (Monday to Sunday) by utilizing a K-Means 
            Clustering algorithm.</p>
        <h2>NaturalCatalyst Enzyme Kinematics Analysis Project: Michaelis Constant Algorithm Development</h2>
        <p>Jan 2022 - May 2022</p>
        <p>MATLAB, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office</p>
        <p>Designed an algorithm using MATLAB that finds the Michaelis Constant using different values.</p>
        <p>Using previous knowledge of data science, developed models that plot the data</p>
        <p>By previous analysis, developed a technical brief of the project</p>
